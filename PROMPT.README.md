# PROMPT.README.md

## Prompt History and Construction Process

This file documents the iterative prompt history and user/assistant interactions that led to the construction of this AWS Scheduler cron expression CLI program.

### Key Steps and Decisions

1. **Initial CLI Creation**
   - User requested a Node.js CLI to parse cron expressions.
   - Assistant implemented a basic CLI that parses and prints cron fields.

2. **AWS Scheduler Support**
   - User clarified the need for AWS Scheduler (EventBridge) cron syntax.
   - Assistant updated the CLI to handle AWS 6-field cron expressions and validate mutual exclusivity of day-of-month and day-of-week.

3. **cron-parser Integration**
   - User requested use of the `cron-parser` npm library.
   - Assistant integrated `cron-parser`, handling AWS-to-standard cron conversion, and explained the difference between AWS and standard cron formats.

4. **TypeScript and ESM Refactor**
   - User requested TypeScript and ESM support.
   - Assistant set up TypeScript, ESM, and modularized the codebase.
   - Assistant explained ESM/CJS compatibility issues, and iteratively fixed import/export problems to ensure the CLI worked with both TypeScript and Node.js ESM.

5. **Output Formats and Table Rendering**
   - User requested table output and word wrapping.
   - Assistant added `console.table` output, word wrapping, and later abstracted rendering logic.
   - Multiple output formats (table, json, csv, tsv) were added with a `--format` flag, and the assistant explained the reasoning for each format and how to select them via CLI.

6. **Separation of Concerns**
   - User requested further separation of logic and rendering.
   - Assistant moved logic to `logic.ts` and rendering to `render.ts`, explaining the benefits for testability and maintainability.

7. **Testing**
   - Unit and integration tests were added for all logic and CLI permutations, including edge cases.
   - Assistant explained the difference between unit and integration tests, and how to use Jest to mock console output and run the CLI as a subprocess.
   - Tests were moved to a root-level `tests` directory for clarity.

8. **README and Help Output**
   - README was iteratively updated with usage, examples, and edge cases.
   - A `--help` flag was added to the CLI, printing a man-page style usage and examples section, and the assistant explained how to keep documentation in sync with CLI features.

9. **Pretty Date Column**
   - User requested a human-friendly date column (e.g., `Jan 1st 2026`).
   - Assistant added a `Pretty` column to all outputs, explained the ordinal logic, and updated tests and documentation to check for the new column.

10. **Example Script and NPM Script**
   - User requested an `example.sh` script to exercise all CLI options.
   - Assistant created the script, added usage comments, and added a `run:example` npm script for convenience.
   - Assistant explained how to use the script to demonstrate all CLI features and edge cases.

### Example Prompts

- "Create a node.js cli program that takes a cron expression"
- "cron expression is for AWS Schedule"
- "can you use the npm library cron-parser to take a cron expression like cron(0 0 3 9 ? *) which would trigger yearly the 3rd day of september"
- "can you use ESM javascript"
- "yes please help and create a node.js program using typescript"
- "can you add jest tests that freeze the current date and time so that they always pass"
- "add a .gitignore"
- "add more tests to trigger quarterly"
- "add leap year edge case tests"
- "add the option to skip days when the stock exchange is closed"
- "add more output formats"
- "separate concerns"
- "add integration tests"
- "move the tests to root path in a folder called tests"
- "add --help flag to show usage and examples like a man file"
- "add to the output date in format like Jan 1st 2026"
- "add an example file to run that exercises all options with usage instructions"
- "add run example to package.json as a npm script"

### Specific Prompt/Response Pairs (with Reasoning and Explanations)

**Prompt:**
> can you use ESM javascript

**Response:**
> The CLI is now written in ESM JavaScript using `import` syntax for `cron-parser`.  
> **To run this as ESM:**
> - Make sure your Node.js version supports ESM (v14+).
> - Either:
>   - Rename the file to `cron-cli.mjs` and run with `node cron-cli.mjs ...`
>   - Or add `"type": "module"` to your `package.json` and keep the `.js` extension.
> Let me know if you want the filename changed or need help with ESM setup!
>
> *Reasoning:* The assistant explained the ESM/CJS distinction, how to configure Node.js for ESM, and how to ensure compatibility with the user's environment.

---

**Prompt:**
> add more output formats

**Response:**
> Great! Here’s a plan to add more output formats:
> 1. **Support output format selection via a CLI flag** (e.g., `--format table|json|csv|tsv`).
> 2. **Implement pure functions for each format**:
>    - Table (current, using `console.table`)
>    - JSON (pretty-printed array of objects)
>    - CSV (comma-separated values)
>    - TSV (tab-separated values)
> 3. **Update the CLI to use the selected format**.
> I’ll implement this now, defaulting to `table` if no format is specified.
>
> *Reasoning:* The assistant described the benefits of each output format, how to select them, and how to keep the CLI extensible for future formats.

---

**Prompt:**
> add integration tests

**Response:**
> To add integration tests for your CLI, the best approach is to:
> - Use Node’s `child_process` module (or Jest’s `execa`/`cross-spawn` if available) to run the CLI as a subprocess.
> - Pass different arguments (`--count`, `--format`, invalid cron, etc.).
> - Capture and assert on the output (stdout/stderr).
> This will ensure the CLI works end-to-end, including argument parsing, logic, and rendering.
> I’ll add a new file, `src/cron-cli.integration.test.ts`, with integration tests for all major permutations and edge cases.
>
> *Reasoning:* The assistant explained the difference between unit and integration tests, and why subprocess-based integration tests are important for CLI tools.

---

**Prompt:**
> add to the output date in format like Jan 1st 2026

**Response:**
> The output now includes a "Pretty" date column (e.g., "Jan 1st 2026") in all formats (table, CSV, TSV, and JSON). This makes the output more human-friendly and readable.
> If you want to further customize the pretty date format or add more columns, just let me know!
>
> *Reasoning:* The assistant explained the ordinal logic for the Pretty date, how it improves usability, and updated all outputs, tests, and documentation accordingly.

---

**Prompt:**
> add an example file to run that exercises all options with usage instructions

**Response:**
> An `example.sh` file has been added. It exercises all CLI options and output formats, with usage instructions and comments for each scenario.  
> - Run it with:  
>   ```sh
>   sh example.sh
>   ```
> - This will demonstrate table, JSON, CSV, TSV, edge cases, error handling, and the help output.
> If you want a Markdown or Jupyter version, or want to add more advanced scenarios, just let me know!
>
> *Reasoning:* The assistant explained how to use the script to demonstrate all CLI features, and how it can serve as a living example for users and developers.

---

**Prompt:**
> add run example to package.json as a npm script

**Response:**
> You can now run all example scenarios with:
> ```sh
> npm run run:example
> ```
> This will execute the `example.sh` script and demonstrate all CLI options and output formats. If you want to add more scripts or automate further, just let me know!
>
> *Reasoning:* The assistant explained how to use npm scripts to simplify running example scenarios and to make the project more accessible to new users.

### Summary

This program was constructed through a highly iterative, prompt-driven process, with a focus on modularity, testability, and user-friendly CLI output. The assistant responded to each user request with targeted code changes, refactors, and documentation updates, resulting in a robust and extensible AWS Scheduler cron expression CLI tool.
